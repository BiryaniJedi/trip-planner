## 💡 Practical Tips

- **Currency**: Indian Rupee (INR). ~₹83 = $1 USD as of late 2024. ATMs widely available; inform your bank before travel.
- **Transport**: Use the **Mumbai Metro** (expanding network) and **AC local trains** for commuting. Ola/Uber are reliable and cheap (~₹200–₹600 for most city rides). Avoid autos for long distances.
- **Weather in November**: Pleasant and dry. Highs ~32°C (90°F), lows ~22°C (72°F). Post-monsoon, so air is clear. Light cottons recommended; bring a light layer for evenings.
- **SIM Card**: Pick up a prepaid Airtel or Jio SIM at the airport arrivals hall with your passport. Unlimited data plans ~₹300/month.
- **Safety**: Mumbai is generally safe for tourists. Standard precautions apply — watch for pickpockets at busy stations and be wary of unofficial "tour guides."
